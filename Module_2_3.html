            <article>How to emphasis with out an header? What is the meaning if you can't
                mention something <strong>Important</strong> and just confuse it as <b>Bold</b>
                words? We want a world has more meaning than a world without meaning. Just like George
                Orwell said in 1984: <q><em>War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.</em></q>

                <br>
                If we can't tell the difference between them, what is the purpose between these emphasis or just something
                <i>Italic</i>? We need to learn from the past, and move on to the future. At this moment, <em>you</em> are 
                carrying your own weight and moving forward. I hope you never stop and keep marching forward without regret.
                Like to true warrior who stands for their villages, I stand for <strong>semantic</strong> meaning!
