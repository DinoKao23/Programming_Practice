        <h1>The Good Life</h1>
        <pre>            When some people talk about money
            They speak as if it were a mysterious lover
            Who went out to buy milk and never
            Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
            For the years I lived on coffee and bread,
            Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday
            Like a woman journeying for water
            From a village without a well, then living
            One or two nights like everyone else
            On roast chicken and red wine.

        <h1>Quote about Stoicism</h1>
        <h3> These are my favorite Stoicism Quote that I want to share with you guys</h3>
        <q>The best answer to anger is silence.</q>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <q>The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.</q>
        <hr>
        <p>And my favorite paragraph in Mediation by Marcus Aurelius:</p>
        <blockquote>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. 
        They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. 
        And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. 
        Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. 
        To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions</blockquote>
